## Slide deck

This presentation was created with [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/).

If you just want to view the deck, you don't have to run a local web serverâ€”just open `slides/index.html` in your browser.

If you'd like to view it live and make changes to the deck:

```
# navigate to the presentation directory
$ cd slides

# install dependencies
$ npm install

# run
$ npm start
```

If your browser doesn't automatically open once the slides are running, navigate to `localhost:8000` to view the live version.
